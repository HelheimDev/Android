# Android v1.0.0
I have uploaded the main files since the whole android application project is such a size that it is not supported by the github.

These files are;
- activity_main.xml
- Main.java
- build.gradle

During this stage the android application can only be run at API-23(Marshmellow) version of Android.
Application is currently runnable on emulator and will be tested on multiple devices the following weeks.
